# Notes

* In the terminal/shell, `.` represents the current directory.

# Shell Commands

> *Note that words within curly braces {} represent placeholders and should be replaced.*

* `mkdir {dir_name}` --> Create new directory

* `cd` --> Go to home directory
* `cd ..` --> Go to parent directory
    * You can navigate your system file using the `cd` command. Use `..` to go to parent folders, and `/` to go into a folder:
        * e.g., `cd ../path/in/parent/folder`

* `touch {file_name}` --> Create new file. When creating files this way, include the extension.

* `ls` --> List files and folders in folder.
* `ls -A` --> List all destinations in folder, including hidden files.
    * As opposed to `-a` flag, `-A` does not list implied paths, such as `.` and `..`
