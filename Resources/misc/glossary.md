# Glossary

* Access Modifiers: Keyword defining the level of protection for a variable, method, or class. This keyword will specify what classes can access these variables, methods, or classes.

* Delta Time: The variable rate at which a scene is being updated based on the elapsed time since the last update. This rate will vary depending on the speed of the computer and how much work needs to be executed by the program at any given time. Delta time is independent from FPS (frames-per-second) given that it is possible for game engine pipelines to be multi-threaded, meaning that the update logic and the render logic will be computed in separate threads or processors.

* Frame Rate: The rate at which the render method is called. They are measured in frames-per-second (FPS). For seamless execution and fluid graphics execution, aim for a minimum of 30 FPS.

* IntelliSense: general term for various code editing features, including: code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists.
