![Perspective Vs. Orthographic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zyGF1.gif)


## Perspective

* Elements get smaller as they are further away from the camera.

* Generally used in 3D first-person and third-person games (e.g., Bioshock).


## Orthographic

* No perspective. Everything is shown as flat.

* Mostly used in 2D games, and in bird's-eye view games (e.g., Age of Empires).
