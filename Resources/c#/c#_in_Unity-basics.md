# C# Basics (in Unity)

## Getting Ready

Write `arg` to the Unity Console Panel: `Debug.Log(arg);`


## Hello World!

``` cs
using System;

class Hello {
    static void main() {
        Debug.Log("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Data Types

You can access all the available C# data types in [this document](./data_types.md).

*Note that this document contains a comprehensive list for reference purposes and for those of you who want to go further, but note that you are unlikely to use all of these when coding in Unity.*
