# Panels

Panels are the small windows that are found in Unity. There are 6 different panels in Unity:

1. Scene
    * Used to place objects in the 2D or 3D space.

2. Game
    * Shows what the game will look like from the camera’s perspective.

3. Hierarchy
    * Shows scenes and objects on the scene.
    * Parenting: Groups objects as children, and allows them to be control by the parent’s transforms.

4. Console
    * Displays errors, warnings, and other messages via Debug.Log

5. Project
    * Finder and File organizer.

6. Inspector
    * Displays information about a game object.

## Tips

* Double clicking on a panel tab maximizes that panel to fit the Unity application window.

* Use **Window > Layouts** or the dropdown menus in the top right of the Unity application window for different panel arrangements.
