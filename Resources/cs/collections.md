# Collections

## Arrays

* Arrays are containers for multiple values of the same type.

* These values can be accessed or modified individually.

* The number of items an array can contain is set when the array is declared, and it cannot be modified afterwards. This is due to memory allocation.

* Arrays are very efficient because the offer random access (the capacity to index directly into objects).

* Elements in an empty array are initialized to a default value. This is `0` for numeric data types, and `null` for all other types.
